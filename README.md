# Howler

## View Deployment:

## Description:

This is a mock landing page for Howler: a fictional social media platform just for dogs.

## Motivation:

After managing a web development project as the Communications Coordinator for a municipality in northern Alberta, I started to teach myself more about web development. To get better acquainted with the topic I completed some online lessons and built several small HTML and CSS projects. To hone my skills I wanted to build a project without any guidance. I built my own version of a previous exercise that I had completed without referring to the tutorial. The Howler landing page is the end result.

## Outcome:

Completing this project helped me to build confidence in writing HTML and CSS. It also provided me with a better understanding of CSS features such as Flexbox, CSS Grid, and relative sizing units for making websites responsive.

## Features:

The Howler landing page includes a features section, a product reviews carousel, and cards that highlight available pricing plans. It is also a fully mobile-responsive page.
